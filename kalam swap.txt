model is trained using both a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data in order to improve learning accuracy and generalization, especially when labeled data is scarce.


Semi-supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that combines supervised and unsupervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data to train artificial intelligence (AI) models for classification and regression tasks.



Why not build a model using the limited amount of labeled data that currently available 

​

Doing so intrudosing the posplty of overfitteng in wich the model preforms will in traing data but strugles to genrlize to new unseen data and the solotion to over fitteng is to incres thesize or comlccty of the data

Model preforms will in training data but struggles to generalize to new unseen data

Problem​ 
Solution 

and the solotion to over fitteng is to 

incres thesize or comlccty of the data ​

Increase data size
Increase data

Increase data complexity


Using a trained model to label
an unlabeled data to create
pseudo-Label
(probabilistic labels that has a
confidence level) and then the
model will be trained again with
the deterministic and the
probabilistic labels​
